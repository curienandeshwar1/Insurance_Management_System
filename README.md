### Modules of the Project

1.Administrator:

This module will focus on all the functionalities associated with the administrator. 
Admin can access the details the details of Policy, Branch and Branch Manager. This includes the authority to add, modify and delete policies, manage branch manager and branch details, etc. This module will be internal to the Insurance Management team and would not be exposed to the end users i.e. customer.

2.Branch manager:

This module will focus on the functionalities for the branch manager. This means developing and implementing functionality to manage customerâ€™s policy operations like register, update and delete policies, functionalities to view and change status of the policy, etc. This would be the most complicated as well as the main module as it will be most exposed during the working of the system.

3.Customer:
